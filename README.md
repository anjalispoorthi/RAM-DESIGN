##Discription: This project focuses on the design and simulation of a simple 8x8 synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) module using Verilog HDL. The RAM supports both read and write operations, controlled by a write enable signal and synchronized with the positive edge of the clock.

The memory has:

8 locations (addressed by a 3-bit address input)

8-bit data width

Synchronous read and write operations performed on the rising clock edge

The design was verified using a Verilog testbench, where values were written into memory and then read back to confirm correctness. The functionality was simulated and visualized using waveform tools in Xilinx Vivado.
